This is an Employee management system project created by using Java language. In this project, I have used pojo class, Interfaces, and Hibernate as the database. purpose of this project is to reduce extra work, if 
a recruiter wants to add a new employee to the database then can easily add or remove the specific employee. We can find any employee by using their name or employee ID and can remove or update their details.
