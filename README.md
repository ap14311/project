This is  The Employee Management system project created by using Java language. In this project, I have used pojo class, Interfaces,  MySQL as a database and Hibernate. The purpose of this project is to reduce extra work, The recruiter wants to add a new employee to the database and then can easily add or remove the specific employee. We can find any employee by using their name or employee ID and can remove or update their details.
